// Requirements

// Your program should have a variable to store the letter grade (an integer between 0 and 100)
// For the letter grades, you may use whatever grading scale you like
// You must use a switch statement (hint, you may need to review and think about how the switch statement works)

var grades = [99,45,100,80,70,60,50];

for(var i = 0; i< grades.length; i++){
  //heres where you put your switch statement
}
